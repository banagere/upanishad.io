## Chapter I — The Creation of Virat

### 1

ॐ आत्मा वा इदमेक एवाग्र आसीन्नान्यत्किंचन मिषत् ।  
स ईक्षत लोकान्नु सृजा इति ॥ १ ॥

In the beginning the Spirit was One and all  
this (universe) was the Spirit; there was  
nought else that saw. The Spirit thought,  
“Lo, I will make me worlds from out my being.”

### 2

स इमाँ ल्लोकानसृजत ।  
अम्भो मरीचीर्मापोऽदोऽम्भः परेण दिवं  
द्यौः प्रतिष्ठाऽन्तरिक्षं मरीचयः ॥  
पृथिवी मरो या अधस्तात्त आपः ॥ २ ॥

He created these worlds:  
Ambhah, the world of water—bearing clouds,  
Marichi, the world of the solar rays,  
Mara, the world of mortals and Ap, the world of waters.  
Yon is Ambhah, above heaven; heaven is its support.  
The Marichis are the interspace. Mara is the earth. What is underneath is Ap.

### 3

स ईक्षतेमे नु लोका लोकपालान्नु सृजा इति ॥  
सोऽद्भ्य एव पुरुषं समुद्धृत्यामूर्छयत् ॥ ३ ॥

He bethought Himself: "Here now are the worlds.  
Let Me now create world—guardians."  
Right from the waters He drew forth the  
Person in the form of a lump and gave Him a shape.

### 4

तमभ्यतपत्तस्याभितप्तस्य मुखं निरभिद्यत यथाऽण्डं  
मुखाद्वाग्वाचोऽग्निर्नासिके निरभिद्येतं नासिकाभ्यां प्राणः ॥

प्राणाद्वायुरक्षिणी निरभिद्येतमक्षीभ्यां चक्षुश्चक्षुष  
आदित्यः कर्णौ निरभिद्येतां कर्णाभ्यां श्रोत्रं  
श्रोत्रद्दिशस्त्वङ्निरभिद्यत त्वचो लोमानि लोमभ्य ओषधिवनस्पतयो  
हृदयं निरभिद्यत हृदयान्मनो मनसश्चन्द्रमा नाभिर्निरभिद्यत  
नाभ्या अपानोऽपानान्मृत्युः  
शिश्नं निरभिद्यत शिश्नाद्रेतो रेतस आपः ॥ ४ ॥

He brooded over Him. From Him, so brooded over,  
the mouth was separated out, as with an egg;  
form the month, the organ of speech;  
from speech, fire, the controlling deity of the organ.  
Then the nostrils were separated out;  
from the nostrils, the organ of breath;  
from breath, air, the controlling deity of the organ.

Then the eyes were separated out; from the eyes, the organ of sight;  
from sight, the sun, the controlling deity of the organ.  
Then the ears were separated out; from the ears, the organ of hearing;  
from hearing, the quarters of space, the controlling deity of the organ.  
Then the skin was separated out; from the skin, hairs, the organ of touch;  
from the hairs, plants and trees, air the controlling deity of the organs.

Then the heart was separated out; from the heart, the organ of the mind;  
from the mind, the moon, the controlling deity of the organ.

Then the navel was separated out; from the navel, the organ of the apana;  
from the apana, Death, Varuna, the controlling deity of the organ.

## Chapter II — Cosmic Powers in the Human Body

### 1

ता एता देवताः सृष्टा अस्मिन्महत्यर्णवे प्रापतन् ।  
तमशनापिपासाभ्यामन्ववार्जत् ।  
ता एनमब्रुवन्नायतनं नः प्रजानीहि यस्मिन्प्रतिष्ठिता अन्नमदामेति ॥ १ ॥

These deities, thus created, fell into this great ocean.  
He subjected the Person to hunger and thirst.  
They said to Him: "Find out for us an abode  
wherein being established we may eat food."

### 2—3

ताभ्यो गामानयत्ता अब्रुवन्न वै नोऽयमलमिति ।  
ताभ्योऽश्वमानयत्ता अब्रुवन्न वै नोऽयमलमिति ॥ २ ॥

ताभ्यः पुरुषमानयत्ता अब्रुवन् सुकृतं बतेति पुरुषो वाव सुकृतम् ।  
ता अब्रवीद्यथायतनं प्रविशतेति ॥ ३ ॥

He brought them a cow. They said: "But this is not enough for us."  
He brought them a horse. They said: "This, too, is not enough for us."  
He brought them a person. The deities said: "Ah, this is well done, indeed."  
Therefore a person is verily something well done.  
He said to the deities: "Now enter your respective abodes."

### 4

अग्निर्वाग्भूत्वा मुखं प्राविशद्वायुः प्राणो भूत्वा नासिके  
प्राविशदादित्यश्चक्षुर्भूत्वाऽक्षिणी प्राविशाद्दिशः  
श्रोत्रं भूत्वा कर्णौ प्राविशन्नोषधिवनस्पतयो लोमानि भूत्वा  
त्वचंप्राविशंश्चन्द्रमा मनो भूत्वा हृदयं प्राविशन्मृत्युरपानो  
भूत्वा नाभिं प्राविशदापो रेतो भूत्वा शिश्नं प्राविशन् ॥ ४ ॥

The deity fire became the organ of speech and entered the mouth.  
Air became breath and entered the nostrils.  
The sun became sight and entered the eyes;  
the quarters of space became hearing and entered the ears.  
Plants and trees, the deity of air, became hairs and entered the skin.  
The moon became the mind and entered the heart.  
Death became the apana and entered the navel.  
The waters became semen and entered the virile member.

### 5

तमशनायापिपासे अब्रूतामावाभ्यामभिप्रजानीहीति ते अब्रवीदेतास्वेव  
वां देवतास्वाभजाम्येतासु भागिन्न्यौ करोमीति ।  
तस्माद्यस्यै कस्यै च देवतायै हविर्गृह्यते  
भागिन्यावेवास्यामशनायापिपासे भवतः ॥ ५ ॥

Hunger and thirst said to the Creator: "For the two of us find an abode also."  
He said to them: "I assign the two of you to these deities;  
I make you co—sharers with them." Therefore to whatsoever deity an oblation is made,  
hunger and thirst became sharers in it.

## Chapter III — The Embodiment of the Supreme Self

### 1

स ईक्षतेमे नु लोकाश्च लोकपालाश्चान्नमेभ्यः सृजा इति ॥ १ ॥

He bethought Himself: "Here now are the worlds and the world—guardians.  
Let Me cerate food for them."

### 2

सोऽपोऽभ्यतपत्ताभ्योऽभितप्ताभ्यो मूर्तिरजायत ।  
या वै सा मूर्तिरजायतान्नं वै तत् ॥ २ ॥

He brooded over the waters. From the waters,  
thus brooded over, there emerged a condensed form.  
The form that so emerged is indeed food.

### 3

तदेनत्सृष्टं पराङ्त्यजिघांसत्तद्वाचाऽजिघृक्षत् तन्नाशक्नोद्वाचा ग्रहीतुम् ।  
स यद्धैनद्वाचाऽग्रहैष्यदभिव्याहृत्य हैवान्नमत्रप्स्यत् ॥ ३ ॥

The food so created wished to flee away.  
He sought to grasp it with speech.  
But He was not able to grasp it with speech.  
If, indeed, He has grasped it with speech,  
one would then have been satisfied by merely uttering the word food

### 4—10

तत्प्राणेनाजिघृक्षत् तन्नाशक्नोत्प्राणेन ग्रहीतुं स यद्धैनत्प्राणेनाग्रहैष्यदभिप्राण्य हैवान्नमत्रप्स्यत् ॥ ४ ॥  
तच्चक्षुषाऽजिघृक्षत् तन्नाशक्नोच्चक्षुषा ग्रहीतु/न् स यद्धैनच्चक्षुषाऽग्रहैष्यद्दृष्ट्वा हैवानमत्रप्स्यत् ॥ ५ ॥  
तच्छ्रोत्रेणाजिघृक्षत् तन्नाशक्नोच्छ्रोत्रेण ग्रहीतुं स यद्धैनच्छ्रोतेणाग्रहैष्यच्छ्रुत्वा हैवान्नमत्रप्स्यत् ॥ ६ ॥  
तत्त्वचाऽजिघृक्षत् तन्नाशक्नोत्त्वचा ग्रहीतुं स यद्धैनत्त्वचाऽग्रहैष्यत् स्पृष्ट्वा हैवान्नमत्रप्स्यत् ॥ ७ ॥  
तन्मनसाऽजिघृक्षत् तन्नाशक्नोन्मनसा ग्रहीतुं स यद्धैनन्मनसाऽग्रहैष्यद्ध्यात्वा हैवान्नमत्रप्स्यत् ॥ ८ ॥  
तच्छिश्नेनाजिघृक्षत् तन्नाशक्नोच्छिश्नेन ग्रहीतुं स यद्धैनच्छिश्नेनाग्रहैष्यद्वित्सृज्य हैवानमत्रप्स्यत् ॥ ९ ॥  
तदपानेनाजिघृक्षत् तदावयत् सैषोऽन्नस्य ग्रहो यद्वायुरनायुर्वा एष यद्वायुः ॥ १० ॥

The Creator sought to grasp it with the breath.  
But He was not able to grasp it with the breath.  
If, indeed, He had grasped it with the breath,  
one would then have been satisfied by merely smelling food.

He sought to grasp it with the eye.  
But He was not able to grasp it with the eye.  
If, indeed, He had grasped it with the eye,  
one would then have been satisfied by merely seeing food.

He sought to grasp it with the ear.  
But He was not able to grasp it with the ear.  
If, indeed, He had grasped it with the ear,  
one would then have been satisfied by merely hearing of food.

He sought to grasp it with the skin.  
But He was not able to grasp it with the skin.  
If, indeed, He had grasped it with the skin,  
one would then have been satisfied by merely touching food.

He sought to grasp it with the mind.  
But He was not able to grasp it with the mind.  
If, indeed, He had grasped it with the mind,  
one would then have been satisfied by merely thinking of food.

He sought to grasp it with the virile member.  
But He was not able to grasp it with the virile member.  
If, indeed, He had grasped it with the virile member,  
one would then have been satisfied by merely emitting food.

He sought to grasp it with the apana and He grasped it.  
This grasper of food is what vayu, air or prana is.  
This vayu is what lives on food.

### 11

स ईक्षत कथं न्विदं मदृते स्यादिति स ईक्षत कतरेण प्रपद्या इति ।  
स ईक्षत यदि वाचाऽभिव्याहृतं यदि प्राणेनाभिप्राणितं यदि चक्षुषा  
दृष्टं यदि श्रोत्रेण श्रुतं यदि त्वचा स्पृष्टं यदि मनसा ध्यातं यद्यपानेनाभ्यपानितं  
यदि शिश्नेन विसृष्टमथ कोऽहमिति ॥ ११ ॥

He bethought Himself: "How could this exist without Me?"  
Then He said to Himself: "Which way shall I enter it?"  
he said to Himself further: "If speech is uttered by the organ of speech,  
if smelling is done by the breath, seeing by the eyes,  
hearing by the ears, touching by the skin,  
thinking by the mind, eating by the apana and  
the emission of semen by the virile member, them who am I?"

### 12

स एतमेव सीमानं विदर्यैतया द्वारा प्रापद्यत ।  
सैषा विदृतिर्नाम द्वास्तदेतन्नाऽन्दनम् ।  
तस्य त्रय आवसथास्त्रयः स्वप्ना  
अयमावसथोऽयमावसथोऽयमावसथ इति ॥ १२ ॥

So, piercing the end, the Lord entered through that door.  
That door is known as the vidriti, the cleft. This is the place of bliss.  
Atman, thus embodied, has three abodes, three conditions of sleep.  
This is one abode, this is another, this is the third.

### 13

स जातो भूतान्यभिव्यैख्यत् किमिहान्यं वावदिषदिति ।  
स एतमेव पुरुषं ब्रह्म ततममपश्यत् ।  
इदमदर्शनमिती ३ ॥ १३ ॥

Having been born as the jiva, He realised the elements as one with Himself.  
What else here would one desire to speak about?  
He perceived this very person as the all—pervading Brahman.  
He said: "Ah, I have seen It."

### 14

तस्मादिदन्द्रो नामेदन्द्रो ह वै नाम ।  
तमिदन्द्रं सन्तमिंद्र इत्याचक्षते परोक्षेण ।  
परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः ॥ १४ ॥

Therefore He is called Idandra. Idandra, indeed is His name.  
Him who is Idandra they call indirectly Indra.  
For the gods appear to be fond of cryptic epithets;  
yea, the gods appear to be fond of cryptic epithets.

## Chapter I — The Three Births of the Self

### 1

ॐ पुरुषे ह वा अयमादितो गर्भो भवति यदेतद्रेतः ।  
तदेतत्सर्वेभ्योऽङ्गेभ्यस्तेजः संभूतमात्मन्येवऽऽत्मानं बिभर्ति  
तद्यदा स्त्रियां सिञ्चत्यथैनज्जनयति तदस्य प्रथमं जन्म ॥ १ ॥

This person is, at first, the germ in a man.  
That which is the semen is here called the germ.  
This semen is the vigour drawn from all the limbs.  
The man bears the self in the self.  
When he pours the semen into a woman, he gives it a birth.  
This, indeed, is the first birth of the embodied soul.

### 2

तत्स्त्रिया आत्मभूयं गच्छति यथा स्वमङ्गं तथा ।  
तस्मादेनां न हिनस्ति ।  
साऽस्यैतमात्मानमत्र गतं भावयति ॥ २ ॥

That semen becomes one with the woman — just like a limb of her own.  
That is why it does not hurt her.  
She nourishes this self of his that has come into her.

### 3

सा भावयित्री भावयितव्या भवति । तं स्त्री गर्भ बिभर्ति ।  
सोऽग्र एव कुमारं जन्मनोऽग्रेऽधिभावयति ।  
स यत्कुमारं जन्मनोऽग्रेऽधिभावयत्यात्मानमेव तद्भावयत्येषं लोकानां सन्तत्या ।  
एवं सन्तता हीमे लोकास्तदस्य द्वितीयं जन्म ॥ ३ ॥

She, being the nourisher, should be nourished.  
The woman nourishes the embryo.  
Immediately after its birth he nourishes the child,  
which in the beginning was already born.  
Nourishing the child from birth onward,  
he thus nourishes himself for the continuation of these worlds.  
For thus alone are these worlds perpetuated. This is one's second birth.

### 4

सोऽस्यायमात्मा पुण्येभ्यः कर्मभ्यः प्रतिधीयते ।  
अथास्यायामितर आत्मा कृतकृत्यो वयोगतः प्रैति ।  
स इतः प्रयन्नेव पुनर्जायते तदस्य तृतीयं जन्म ॥ ४ ॥

He who is the one self of his, is made his substitute for virtuous deeds.  
Then the other self of his, having accomplished his duties and  
reached his age departs. So departing hence, he is born again.  
This is the third birth.

### 5

तदुक्तमृषिणा गर्भे नु सन्नन्वेषामवेदमहं देवानां जनिमानि  
विश्वा शतं मा पुर आयसीररक्षन्नधः श्येनो जवसा निरदीयमिति ।  
गर्भ एवैतच्छयानो वामदेव एवमुवाच ॥ ५ ॥

About this a rishi has said: "While still lying in the womb,  
I came to know all the births of the gods.  
A hundred strongholds, as if made of iron, confined me,  
yet I burst through them all swiftly, like a hawk."  
Vamadeva spoke, in this wise, even while lying in the womb.

### 6

स एवं विद्वानस्माच्छरीरभेदादूर्ध्व उत्क्रम्यामुष्मिन् स्वर्गे लोके  
सर्वान् कामानाप्त्वाऽमृतः समभवत् समभवत् ॥ ६ ॥

Thus endowed with Knowledge, he,  
becoming one with the Supreme Self and  
soaring aloft on the dissolution of the body,  
obtained all desires in the heavenly world and  
became immortal—yea, became immortal.

# Part Three

## Chapter I — Concerning the Self

### 1

ॐ कोऽयमात्मेति वयमुपास्महे कतरः स आत्मा ।  
येन वा पश्यति येन वा श‍ृणोति येन वा गंधानाजिघ्रति  
येन वा वाचं व्याकरोति येन वा स्वादु चास्वादु च विजानाति ॥ १ ॥

Who is He whom we worship, thinking: "This is the Self"?  
Which one is the Self? Is it He by whom one sees form,  
by whom one hears sound and by whom one tastes the sweet and the unsweet?

### 2

यदेतद्धृदयं मनश्चैतत् । संज्ञानमाज्ञानं विज्ञानं प्रज्ञानं मेधा  
दृष्टिर्धृतिमतिर्मनीषा जूतिः स्मृतिः संकल्पः क्रतुरसुः कामो वश इति ।  
सर्वाण्येवैतानि प्रज्ञानस्य नामधेयानि भवंति ॥ २ ॥

Is it the heart and the mind. It is consciousness, lordship, knowledge,  
wisdom, retentive power of mind, sense knowledge, steadfastness, though,  
thoughtfulness, sorrow, memory, concepts, purpose, life, desire, longing:  
all these are but various names of Consciousness (Prajnanam).

### 3

एष ब्रह्मैष इन्द्र एष प्रजापतिरेते सर्वे देवा इमानि च  
पञ्चमहाभूतानि पृथिवी वायुराकाश आपो  
ज्योतींषीत्येतानीमानि च क्षुद्रमिश्राणीव ।  
बीजानीतराणि चेतराणि चाण्डजानि च जारुजानि च स्वेदजानि चोद्भिज्जानि  
चाश्वा गावः पुरुषा हस्तिनो यत्किञ्चेदं प्राणि जङ्गमं च पतत्रि  
च यच्च स्थावरं सर्वं तत्प्रज्ञानेत्रं प्रज्ञाने प्रतिष्ठितं  
प्रज्ञानेत्रो लोकः प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठा प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म ॥ ३ ॥

He is Brahman, He is Indra, He is Prajapati; He is all these gods;  
He is the five great elements—earth, air, akasa, water, light;  
He is all these small creatures and the others which are mixed;  
He is the origin—those born of an egg, of a womb, of sweat and of a sprout;  
He is horses, cows, human beings, elephants—whatever breathes here,  
whether moving on legs or flying in the air or unmoving.  
All this is guided by Consciousness, is supported by Consciousness.  
The basis is Consciousness. Consciousness is Brahman.

### 4

स एतेन प्राज्ञेनाऽऽत्मनाऽस्माल्लोकादुत्क्रम्यामुष्मिन्स्वर्गे लोके सर्वान्  
कामानाप्त्वाऽमृतः समभवत् समभवत् ॥ ४ ॥

He, having realised oneness with Pure Consciousness,  
soared from this world and having obtained all desires in yonder heavenly world,  
became immortal—yea, became immortal.
