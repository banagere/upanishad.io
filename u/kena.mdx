## Part 1

### 1

केनेषितं पतति प्रेषितं मनः।  
केन प्राणः प्रथमः प्रैति युक्तः।  
केनेषितां वाचमिमां वदन्ति।  
चक्षुः श्रोत्रं क उ देवो युनक्ति ॥

By whom missioned falls the mind shot to its mark? By whom yoked moves the first life - breath forward on its paths? By whom impelled is this word that men speak? What god set eye and ear to their workings?

### 2

श्रोत्रस्य श्रोत्रं मनसो मनो यत्।  
वाचो ह वाचं स उ प्राणस्य प्राणः।  
चक्षुषश्चक्षुरतिमुच्य धीराः।  
प्रेत्यास्माल्लोकादमृता भवन्ति ॥

That which is hearing of our hearing, mind of our mind, speech of our speech, that too is life of our life -breath and sight of our sight. The wise are released beyond and they pass from this world and become immortal.

### 3

न तत्र चक्षुर्गच्छति न वाग्गच्छति नो मनो  
न विद्मो न विजानीमो यथैतदनुशिष्यात्।  
अन्यदेव तद्विदितादथो अविदितादधि।  
इति शुश्रुम पूर्वेषां ये नस्तद्व्याचचक्षिरे ॥

There sight travels not, nor speech, nor the mind. We know It not nor can distinguish how one should teach of It: for It is other than the known; It is there above the unknown. It is so we have heard from men of old who declared That to our understanding.

### 4

यद्वाचानभ्युदितं येन वागभ्युद्यते।  
तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते ॥

That which is unexpressed by the word, that by which the word is expressed, know That to be the Brahman and not this which men follow after here.

### 5

यन्मनसा न मनुते येनाहुर्मनो मतम्‌।  
तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते ॥

That which thinks not by the mind, that by which the mind is thought, know That to be the Brahman and not this which men follow after here.

### 6

यच्चक्षुषा न पश्यति येन चक्षूंषि पश्यति।  
तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते ॥

That which sees not with the eye, that by which one sees the eye's seeings, know That to be the Brahman and not this which men follow after here.

### 7

यच्छ्रोत्रेण न शृणोति येन श्रोत्रमिदं श्रुतम्‌।  
तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते ॥

That which hears not with the ear, that by which the ear's hearing is heard, know That to be the Brahman and not this which men follow after here.

### 8

यत्प्राणेन न प्राणिति येन प्राणः प्रणीयते।  
तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते ॥

That which breathes not with the breath, that by which the life -breath is led forward in its paths, know That to be the Brahman and not this which men follow after here.

## Part 2

### 1

यदि मन्यसे सुवेदेति दभ्रमेवापि नूनं त्वं वेत्थ ब्रह्मणो रूपम्‌।  
यदस्य त्वं यदस्य देवेष्वथ नु मीमांस्यमेव ते मन्ये विदितम्‌ ॥

If thou thinkest that thou knowest It well, little indeed dost thou know the form of the Brahman. That of It which is thou, that of It which is in the gods, this thou hast to think out. I think It known.

### 2

नाहं मन्ये सुवेदेति नो न वेदेति वेद च।  
यो नस्तद्वेद तद्वेद नो न वेदेति वेद च ॥

I think not that I know It well and yet I know that It is not unknown to me. He of us who knows It, knows That; he knows that It is not unknown to him.

### 3

यस्यामतं तस्य मतं मतं यस्य न वेद सः।  
अविज्ञातं विजानतां विज्ञातमविजानताम्‌ ॥

He by whom It is not thought out, has the thought of It; he by whom It is thought out, knows It not. It is unknown to the discernment of those who discern of It, by those who seek not to discern of It, It is discerned.

### 4

प्रतिबोधविदितं मतममृतत्वं हि विन्दते।  
आत्मना विन्दते वीर्यं विद्यया विन्दतेऽमृतम्‌ ॥

When It is known by perception that reflects It, then one has the thought of It, for one finds immortality; by the self one finds the force to attain and by the knowledge one finds immortality.

### 5

इह चेदवेदीदथ सत्यमस्ति।  
न चेदिहावेदीन्महती विनष्टिः।  
भूतेषु भूतेषु विचित्य धीराः।  
प्रेत्यास्माल्लोकादमृता भवन्ति ॥

If here one comes to that knowledge, then one truly is; if here one comes not to the knowledge, then great is the perdition. The wise distinguish That in all kinds of becomings and they pass forward from this world and become immortal.

## Part 3

### 1

ब्रह्म ह देवेभ्यो विजिग्ये तस्य ह ब्रह्मणो विजये देवा अमहीयन्त।  
त ऐक्शन्तास्माकमेवायं विजयोऽस्माकमेवायं महिमेति ॥

The Eternal conquered for the gods and in the victory of the Eternal the gods grew to greatness. They saw, “Ours the victory, ours the greatness.”

### 2

तद्धैषां विजज्ञौ तेभ्यो ह प्रादुर्बभूव तन्न व्यजानत किमिदं यक्षमिति ॥

The Eternal knew their thought and appeared before them; and they knew not what was this mighty Daemon.

### 3

तेऽग्निमब्रुवन् जातवेद एतद्विजानीहि किमेतद्यक्षमिति तथेति ॥

They said to Agni, “O thou that knowest all things born, learn of this thing, what may be this mighty Daemon,” and he said, “So be it.”

### 4

तदभ्यद्रवत्तमभ्यवदत्कोऽसीत्यग्निर्वा अहमस्मीत्यब्रवीज्जातवेदा वा अहमस्मीति ॥

He rushed towards the Eternal and It said to him, “Who art thou?” “I am Agni,” he said, “I am he that knows all things born.”

### 5

तस्मिंस्त्वयि किं वीर्यमित्यपीदं सर्वं दहेयं यदिदं पृथिव्यामिति ॥

“Since such thou art, what is the force in thee?” “Even all this I could burn, all that is upon the earth.”

### 6

तस्मै तृणं निदधावेतद्दहेति तदुपप्रेयाय सर्वजवेन तन्न शशाक दग्धुं स तत एव निववृते नैतदशकं विज्ञातुं यदेतद्यक्शमिति ॥

The Eternal set before him a blade of grass; “This burn;” and he made towards it with all his speed, but could not burn it. There he ceased, and turned back; “I could not know of It, what might be this mighty Daemon.”

### 7

अथ वायुमब्रुवन् वायवेतद्विजानीहि किमेतद्यक्शमिति तथेति ॥

Then they said to Vayu, “O Vayu, this discern, what is this mighty Daemon.” He said, “So be it.”

### 8

तदभ्यद्रवत्तमभ्यवदत् कोऽसीति वायुर्वा अहमस्मीत्यब्रवीन्मातरिश्वा वा अहमस्मीति ॥

He rushed upon That; It said to him, “Who art thou?” “I am Vayu,” he said, “and I am he that expands in the Mother of things.”

### 9

तस्मिंस्त्वयि किं वीर्यमित्यपीदं सर्वमाददीय यदिदं पृथिव्यामिति ॥

“Since such thou art, what is the force in thee?” “Even all this I can take for myself, all this that is upon the earth.”

### 10

तस्मै तृणं निदधावेतदादत्स्वेति तदुपप्रेयाय सर्वजवेन तन्न शशाकादातुं स तत एव निववृते नैतदशकं विज्ञातुं यदेतद्यक्शमिति ॥

That set before him a blade of grass; “This take.” He went towards it with all his speed and he could not take it. Even there he ceased, even thence he returned; “I could not discern of That, what is this mighty Daemon.”

### 11

अथेन्द्रमब्रुवन् मघवन्नेतद्विजानीहि किमेतद्यक्शमिति तथेति तदभ्यद्रवत् तस्मात्तिरोदधे ॥

Then they said to Indra, “Master of plenitudes, get thou the knowledge, what is this mighty Daemon.” He said, “So be it.” He rushed upon That. That vanished from before him.

### 12

स तस्मिन्नेवाकाशे स्त्रियमाजगाम बहुशोभमानामुमां हैमवतीं तां होवाच किमेतद्यक्शमिति ॥

He in the same ether came upon the Woman, even upon Her who shines out in many forms, Uma daughter of the snowy summits. To her he said, “What was this mighty Daemon?”

## Part 4

### 1

सा ब्रह्मेति होवाच ब्रह्मणो वा एतद्विजये महीयध्वमिति ततो हैव विदाञ्चकार ब्रह्मेति ॥

She said to him, “It is the Eternal. Of the Eternal is this victory in which ye shall grow to greatness.” Then alone he came to know that this was the Brahman.

### 2

तस्माद्वा एते देवा अतितरामिवान्यान्देवान्यदग्निर्वायुरिन्द्रस्ते ह्येनन्नेदिष्ठं पस्पर्शुस्ते ह्येनत्प्रथमो विदाञ्चकार ब्रह्मेति ॥

Therefore are these gods as it were beyond all the other gods, even Agni and Vayu and Indra, because they came nearest to the touch of That...

### 3

तस्माद् वा इन्द्रोऽतितरामिवान्यान्देवान्स ह्येनन्नेदिष्ठं पस्पर्श स ह्येनत्प्रथमो विदाञ्चकार ब्रह्मेति ॥

Therefore is Indra as it were beyond all the other gods because he came nearest to the touch of That, because he first knew that it was the Brahman.

### 4

तस्यैष आदेशो यदेतद्विद्युतो व्यद्युतदा इतीन्न्यमीमिषदा इत्यधिदैवतम्‌ ॥

Now this is the indication of That,-as is this flash of the lightning upon us or as is this falling of the eyelid, so in that which is of the gods.

### 5

अथाध्यात्मं यद्देतद् गच्छतीव च मनोऽनेन चैतदुपस्मरत्यभीक्श्णं सङ्कल्पः ॥

Then in that which is of the Self,-as the motion of this mind seems to attain to That and by it afterwards the will in the thought continually remembers It.

### 6

तद्ध तद्वनं नाम तद्वनमित्युपासितव्यं स य एतदेवं वेदाभि हैनम् सर्वाणि भूतानि संवाञ्छन्ति॥

The name of That is “That Delight”; as That Delight one should follow after It. He who so knows That, towards him verily all existences yearn.

### 7

उपनिषदं भो ब्रूहीत्युक्ता त उपनिषद् ब्राह्मीं वाव त उपनिषदमब्रूमेति ॥

Thou hast said “Speak to me Upanishad”; spoken to thee is Upanishad. Of the Eternal verily is the Upanishad that we have spoken.

### 8

तस्यै तपो दमः कर्मेति प्रतिष्ठा वेदाः सर्वाङ्गानि सत्यमायतनम्‌ ॥

Of this knowledge austerity and self-conquest and works are the foundation, the Vedas are all its limbs, truth is its dwelling place.

### 9

यो वा एतामेवं वेदापहत्य पाप्मानमनन्ते स्वर्गे लोके ज्येये प्रतितिष्ठति प्रतितिष्ठति ॥

He who knows this knowledge, smites evil away from him and in that vaster world and infinite heaven finds his foundation, yea, he finds his foundation.
